# Autonomous_Parallel_Parking
# Abstract 
The objective of our project is to design and build the Intelligent Parallel Parking and Obstacle Avoidance System. The system is comprised of autonomous vehicle navigation and microprocessing systems installed on a model car. The system measures an available parking space, checks whether the space is large enough for parking, aligns the car correctly in the traffic lane and then performs the necessary parallel parking maneuvers into the parking spot. In addition to parallel parking, the system can detect static obstacles, like road blocks and dynamic obstacles, like pedestrians, in the vehicleâ€™s path. If dynamic obstacles are detected, the vehicle stops until the obstacle moves out of the way. If static obstacles are detected, the vehicle maneuvers around the obstacle ensuring a collision free trajectory. The product provides an economic solution to autonomous parallel parking and can be added to any regular vehicle thus encompassing a wider customer base.
